# Power BI Esports Analytics Dashboard 🎮📊

## Problem Statement 🎯
In competitive gaming, raw statistics such as kills, deaths, map picks, and agent selections are abundant, but without structured analysis they don’t reveal the full story of team dominance, player efficiency, or strategic preferences.

## Analysis 📊
Using **Excel** for data cleaning and preparation, I transformed raw tournament data into a structured dataset. With **Power BI**, I built interactive dashboards to uncover insights such as:
- ⚔️ **15K kills and 13K deaths**, resulting in a balanced KD ratio of 1.00.
- 🏆 **DRX** leading all teams in kills.
- 🔥 **FLASHBACK** securing the top individual spot with 380 kills.
- 🗺️ **Abyss** as the most preferred map (32% pick rate).
- 👤 **Omen** as the most selected agent (29.44%), followed by Sova, Yoru, Viper, and Fade.
- 💰 **BRAWK from NRG** achieving the highest ECON rating of 63.47.
- 🔫 **KAAJAK** leading in First Bloods, demonstrating his impact in initiating rounds.

## Conclusion ✅
By structuring and analyzing the data, the problem of scattered statistics is resolved: the dashboards clearly show **which teams dominate (DRX), which players lead individually (FLASHBACK, KAAJAK), and how strategic choices (Abyss, Omen) shape outcomes**. This project demonstrates that combining **Excel for preparation** and **Power BI for visualization** transforms raw numbers into actionable insights — turning fragmented data into a clear performance narrative.

## Tools Used 🛠️
- **Excel** → Data cleaning & preparation
